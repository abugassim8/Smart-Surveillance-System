# Smart Surveillance System

Smart Surveillance system is a software tool providing its user with the ability to surveil a given area and notify with relevant watch list information. The application spans to adding a new person previously unknown to the system so that the entire functionality of the system can be extended, thus making surveillance tasks easier and more efficient.

First an algorithm is an effective method that can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. Formally, Face Recognition is defined as the problem of identifying or verifying faces in an image. How exactly do we recognize a face in an image?
Face recognition can be divided into multiple steps.
  1. Face detection — Detecting one or more faces in an image.
  2. Feature extraction — Extracting the most important features from an image of the face.
  3. Face classification — Classifying the face based on extracted features.

By using those steps the system updates it's recognition database from the data it is given. The accuracy depends on the quality and size of the data it is fed and displays the profiles of the people that are recognized all using a modern GUI.
